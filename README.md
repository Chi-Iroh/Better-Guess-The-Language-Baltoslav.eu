# Better Guess The Language - Baltoslav.eu

I really like [baltoslav.eu's "Guess The Language"](https://baltoslav.eu/adhadaj/index.php) game, so I decided to create a Firefox add-on to add some features.  
Each round, we have a table of 10 words/expressions in English (depends on your language setting on the website) and in another unnamed language.  
Below are many choices (3 at the beginning, up to 9 later) and we must select the good one.  
We have 3 lives, and each error removes one life and shows us the words table with the language we selected versus the right answer.  
When no life is remaining, we're took back to the main page.  

## Features
- Table timeout : The words table automatically disappears after 1 second (not when we lose)

## Features (planned)
- Adding a way to customize the table timeout
- A help text when we lose a point to explain why we lost (wrong writing system, that character doesn't exist in the language you chose etc..)
- Speedrun mode : adds a timer to show how much time was spent since the beginning
- Replacing language buttons (limited choices) by a search bar where we must write and select the language (no help)

## Icon
As baltoslav.eu is all rights reserved, I cannot use its favicon.  
Instead, I used [this icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/languages_3898840?term=language&page=1&position=9&origin=tag&related_id=3898840).
